# Prezi_PE

This is a presentation peer feedback that uses a simple QR code generator that takes a string input, appends it to a Google Form URL, and displays a scannable QR code.

Presentation skills are crucial for students to convey complex ideas, essential for teamwork and highly valued by employers. To develop these skills effectively, improved training and active peer feedback are necessary.
This is a prototype of work presented at 2024 AAEE:
